### AI-SP
The APML CA 1 and APML CA 2 files show case the programming and results of my study for Machine learning in SP.
CA 1 focuses on supervised machine learning while CA 2 focuses on unsupervised learning and image recognition

# Summary for CA 1
The titanic data set was used for classification purposes. The data was used to predict if a passenger surivived based on his data. Models like KNearestNeighbours and DTC were used and tuned to see which is the most appropriate model for the prediction task. KC housing data was used for regression purposes to predict housing prices. Models like Ridge and Lasso were used.

# Summary for CA 2
The Wine dataset was used for classification purposes. This classification task differs from CA 1 because the wines were not given a label whereas the titanic passengers were labelled survived or not. In this assignment, we had to determine how many different types of wines there are based on the data for their chemical analysis. Models used were GMM and K-means clustering. For the 2nd part, The MINST dataset for fashion was used for the image recognition task. The task was to predict from images to classify clothing under different categories. Models like MLP and CNN were used for the image recognition. The models were also hyperparameter tuned to minimise the error rate.
